#### ðŸ’Ž Vanity Wallet
> Add some personality to your wallet address 

The **v4R2** standard is used. There is no such thing as Â«continue from the same placeÂ», since the number of wallets can be said to be infinite. You can stop the search whenever you want and safely start the search again. The chance to knock out someone's wallet is zero, so there will never be repetitions anyway ðŸ‘€

### How to use
- Make sure you are using the **16** version of Node.js: **node -v**
- Install project dependencies: **npm install**
- Set wallet search options in **config/setup.js**
- Run script: **npm run dev**

### Additionally
- To stop the script, use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + C**
- Wallets will be saved in the **wallets** folder and will not get into GitHub in any way

### How to enable notifications in Telegram
- Create your own bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (you can use [this avatar](https://github.com/TON-NFT/custon/blob/main/assets/bot-avatar.png) for your bot)
- Paste the received bot token into **config/tg.js**
- Run script: **npm run dev**
- Write a **/start** command to the bot, he will send your **chatId**
- Paste the received chatId into **config/tg.js**
- Restart script: **Ctrl + C**, then **npm run dev**
